# Free Code Camp: Responsive Web Design
## Project 2: Build a Survey Form

**Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP.

### Thoughts
I did not find this much more challenging than the first FCC project, but finding little things along the way that are interesting - when looking at the example CodePen I did not see the purpose of the .form-group divs, so I initially did not include them in my own attempt, as I planned to just style the elements directly.

When I tried this however, it did not have the desired effect - I added a margin to all of the input, select and label elements - this made the form disjointed and a bit confusing to use. I started to style these elements individually before I realized it would be simpler to have a single class that wrapped each form grouping - it was a nice *Aha!* moment for me.

I was planning on skipping the next two projects in thise course but have decided against it as I feel I may learn something from them - I have from the first two thus far. Additionally, its forcing me to spend time in the terminal using git and setting up projects.

Already I have set up a HTML boilerplate to start new projects.

I am making my way through **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** which is an amazing free resource for people starting on their web developer journey.
